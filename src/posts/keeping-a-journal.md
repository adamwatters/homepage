If you’re looking for advice on starting and maintaining a daily journaling habit, read on.

Six months ago I opened a new journal and wrote about my day. I wrote again the next day, and the day after that. I kept writing, and, incrementally, what started as an effort became a consistent and enjoyable part of my day.

My habit took me by surprise — I had tried and failed to keep a journal before. I have in front of me the artifact of my previous best attempt, a tattered spiral bound notebook half filled with dated entries spanning seven weeks of my chaotic mid twenties. It’s disorganized and sloppy. Some entries run on manically for pages, some cut off abruptly mid sentence two lines in. Pages are missing. The final entry in the notebook starts, “Not even going to try going back over the two weeks I missed. Those days are lost to history”. It was the death whimper of a malformed habit.

Back in the present, my journaling practice is alive and well, and I’ve been thinking about why. What’s different this time around? Certainly I’ve changed over the past two years, but more then changes in my personality and circumstances, I attribute the stability of my current journaling habit to a loose methodology I mostly stumbled into. And so, without further ado, I present to you my five keys to starting and keeping a daily journal.

1. Have a good reason to journal.

Maybe some people can brute force their way into a productive habit, but I need a bedrock-level justification for doing things that are not immediately and obviously pleasurable. Yours might be completely different, but here’s mine to try on for size…

Historically I have tended towards discursive thought and the pursuit of orthogonal goals. Looking back from the precipice of 30, I can see that my life has lacked narrative coherence. I have an intuition that journaling, literally writing my story as I live it, will give me enough purchase on my days to start shaping my weeks, months, and years in a meaningful direction. So far so good.

Of course, abstract ideas about why you should journal won’t do you much good without a pen and some paper, which brings me to key number two.

2. Write in a planner.

My journal has one lined page for every day of the year, each with the day of the week plus the month and day printed in the header. Writing in a planner instead of a blank notebook has solved the problems of organization and consistency that derailed my past attempts at journaling.

When you write in a planner, you don’t not have to think about how much to write on any given day — the answer is always one page. This constraint keeps me from burning myself out writing for two hours on days when I feel inspired then phoning it in with a couple sentences or failing to record anything on days when I’m busy or tired.

With one and only one page for each day, you do not have the option of starting from scratch. In the past I would let my inner critic stop me in my tracks a sentence or two into an entry, and as a result I have stacks of notebooks with half the pages torn out. The imposed structure of a daily planner has helped me to be OK with whatever words happened to land on the page on a given day.

Writing in a planner creates a visual representation of your streak. It gamifies journaling. Think of a runner making big green check marks on her calendar for each day she goes for a run. When you journal in a planner, that’s all built in. When I need motivation to keep going, I just fan through the pages of my journal and bask in the warm glow of tangible progress. To maximize this effect, you need an unbroken streak, which brings me to…

3. Be obsessive about filling every page.

I frame my journaling practice with the specific goal of writing one entry for every day of the year. This goal is concrete enough to keep me accountable but flexible enough for me to recover from slips. Ideally every entry is a hot-from-the-oven account of my daily lived experience, but the only hard rule is I fill each page with meaningful sentences.

I don’t write in my journal every single day — sometimes I write two or three entries in one night. One thing journaling has made painfully obvious to me is that the half-life of my working autobiographical memory is about 72 hours. If I’m trying to fill in a page more then 72 hours in the past, something I’ve done maybe 5 times in the past 6 months, I go digging for clues on my calendar, in my text messages, and in my emails. Usually if I focus on one kernel of found information I can reconstruct enough of the day to hit a page.

Once in the past 6 months I truly lost a day. Looking back from a couple weeks after the missed day, I had a guess it was a day I spent depressed and unable to do anything but lay in bed reading a John Grisham novel. So, short of any other material, I wrote a one page summary of the page-turner I may or may not have spent half that day reading.

Conveniently, the easiest and most satisfying way to meet the baseline goal of filling one page of journal for every day is to achieve the ideal of writing about each day as it comes. This gets easier with practice, so it’s best to…

4. Start small

When I started my daily journal I wrote in a pocket sized moleskin daily planner. I could fit between 100 and 150 words on each page. This was a very low bar, and on days that I wasn’t completely brain dead I could be done with my entry in under 5 minutes. Importantly, on days that I was completely brain dead I could still manage to sit down and fill a page.

Starting small takes the pressure off the actual words while you build up other skills involved in journaling. You’ll learn to carry your journal and a pen everywhere you go. You squash any pesky self-consciousness about writing in public. Writing by hand is a practicable skill, and if you’re as out of practice as I was you’ll likely see improvement in the speed and legibility of your handwriting.

After about a month I started feeling consistently shorted by my 3.5x5.5 inch rectangle of paper, but I stuck with it. Writing small will force you to be concise. It will force you to write neatly, which I suspect will push you to think more neatly.

Eventually it was just too painfully to limit myself to one page and I started cheating, extending my entries onto blank pages in the front of my journal. On my next trip to the bookstore I picked up a full sized planner. Now I write around 350 words a day. When you reach this same point, congratulate yourself on living a more interesting life or paying closer attention to the life you have (is there really a difference?) and gift yourself some more real estate.

Journaling has become the most productive creative habit in my life. My journal is the place where I can record the conversations I want to remember, zoom out and observe the patterns of my life, or continue a line of thought over the course of weeks. I hope my advice gives you the structure and confidence to start and keep your own journal, and that you find the practice as useful as I have.
