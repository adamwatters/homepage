I'm a web engineer in New York City. Currently I'm hacking on [Picaday](https://picaday.club/) and on the lookout for opportunities to join talented teams working on ambitious projects. I also like to [build things IRL](https://www.instagram.com/adam.watters/).

I worked at [TheLadders](https://www.theladders.com/) and [HealthKick](https://www.health-kick.com/). Before that I spent a few months at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) writing a ton of Javascript, mostly in the form of web apps and in-browser games.

## Some things I've built...

### Picaday

<img class="project-img" src="/public/img/picaday.png">
<p>An app for uploading pictures of the same thing every day (e.g. your face) and stiching them together to see change over time (e.g. a beard growing out of your face). The technical goal is to build an in-browser app that feels as seemless as a native app. The broader goal is to build something complete strangers will use and love. <a href="https://picaday.club/">Try it out for yourself</a>.</p>

### Heartwood Library

<img class="project-img" src="/public/img/heartwood-library.jpg">
<p>A Rails powered Library Catalog application built for the traditional building school where I spent the summer of 2016 building Timber Frames. <a href="https://heartwoodlibrary.herokuapp.com/">Check it out here</a>.</p>

### Arduino LED InfoTicker

<p>Combined hardware hacking, data scraping, and API building to stream bus, train, Citibike, weather, and bitcoin data across an LED ticker. More about how it was built <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Web-Controlled-LED-Info-Ticker/">here</a>.</p>

### InstructaBubbles
<img class="project-img" src="/public/img/instructabubbles.png">
<p>An alternative UI for navigating Instructables.com content built with Node, D3.js, and the Instructables API available via Mashape.com. <a href="https://instructabubbles.herokuapp.com/">Go ahead and poke around</a>.</p>
